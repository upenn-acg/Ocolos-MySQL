(1) in src/lib.rs, please modify line 14 ~ line 19.
    in src/server/main.rs, please modify line line 9 ~ line 13.
    1. "PERF_DATA_DIR" is the directory where you store all of your perf.data.
    2. "CLANG_BOLT_PATH" is the path where you place your BOLTed clang.
    3. "NUM_PERF_DATA" the number of first X perf.data you want to generate,
       where X = NUM_PERF_DATA 
    4. "NUM_PERF2BOLT_IN_PARALLEL" can at most be 6, due to the limitation of 
       main memory. 

(2) 1. type "cargo build" to build the library and server binary. 
    2. The built library "librca.so" is in target/debug.
    3. The built binary "server" is in target/debug

(3) here is a simple example to add this library: 
    suppose we want to run "clang main.c -o main" we should run it in this way: 
    1. in one terminal, start the server by "./target/debug/server" 
    2. in another terminal, start the client by the following command:
       LD_PRELOAD={your path}/floar/rca-clang-new/target/debug/librca.so /bin/sh -c "{your path}/llvm-project/build/bin/clang main.c -o main"
       (you should replace {your path} to your real path for "floar" and "clang")
    3. each time you want to use rca-clang-server-client to build something new, 
       please restart server.
